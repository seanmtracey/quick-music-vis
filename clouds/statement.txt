Mission Statement

B & W Meet is an informal pub meet for Bournemouth-based digital creatives. It doesn't matter where you're from or how experienced you are as long as you're passionate about the web. Weâ€™ll always be free and open to all.

NB> I realise this isn't very punchy for a poster but feel free to take snippets or I can write something specifically for a poster but here's the mission statement.
